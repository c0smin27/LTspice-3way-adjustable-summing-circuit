# LTspice three-way adjustable summing circuit with amplifier output

**Circuit information** <br>

In the summing configuration, the AO takes several input signals and combines them, producing a single output that is the amplified sum of the input signals. The bi-alternating current mirror is realized by a combination of transistors and resistors, so that the output current is directly controlled and influenced by the input current. This stage of the circuit also acts as isolation between the input and output, aiming to reduce noise levels and stabilise output impedance for better sound quality.
